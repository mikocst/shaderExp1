# Shader Experiment 1
I've recently been fascinated by shaders because I feel like it adds a lot of character to 3D models. I wanna be practicing how to manipulate and incorporate shaders into my projects so my models look crisp.

# Day 1 of experimenting.
Yesterday, I was introduced to shaders and got the gist of how to set them up, use shader material, and manipulate textures to form a fun text pattern on a torus. We'll see what we come up with today!
